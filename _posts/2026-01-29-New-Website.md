# Hello World

This is my first post figuring out how to host websits on GitHub pages and then connect them to my own personal domain. This will be populated with things I like and things I do in my spare time.
If you want to see a digital version of my resume, it is on the about section on the left (if on desktop) or in the hamburger menu (if on handheld).
